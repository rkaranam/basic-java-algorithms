Data Structures in Java

1. You cannot call a sort method on an ArrayList.

2. Some of the key collection classes are:
	
	TreeSet
		Keeps the elements sorted and prevents duplicates

	HashMap
		Let's you store and access elements as name/value pairs

	LinkedList
		Designed to give better performance when you insert or delete 
		elements from the middle of the collection

	HashSet
		Prevents duplicates in the collection, and given an element, can 
		find that element in the collection quickly

	LinkedHashMap
		Like a regular HashMap, except it can remember the order in which 
		elements (name/value pairs) were inserted, or it can be configured 
		to remember the order in which elements were last accessed
		
3. Every time you insert into a TreeSet, the TreeSet has to take the time 
   to figure out where in the tree the new element must go, so it is expensive

4. It's slower to insert something in an ArrayList somewhere other than at 
   the end. So using the overloaded add(index, element) method doesn't work
   as quickly as calling the add(element) - which puts the added element at
   the end
